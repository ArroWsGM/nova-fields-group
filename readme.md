#Nova Fields Group

Attempt to add the ability to group fields into columns for creating complex admin layouts in Laravel Nova.

This not working yet due to really bad Nova developers documentation, a total absence of users support (really guys, don't buy it) and high Nova's code complexity.

Initially it was based on the field component, but eventually, I'm trying to switch to panel-based design, thanx to eminiarts/nova-tabs.
